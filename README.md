----- 

<br/>Sync with Library is a Sketch plugin to easily replace local symbols and layer&text styles with library ones.<br/>

It will scan your document and active libraries and find any symbol or style with the same name as your local ones, and let you decide which ones you want to replace and which you want to keep.
